Version 1.8.1 2013-08-26
- Concurrency issue in CompressingFilterStats fixed
  thx to almubinsultan

Version 1.8 2013-06-26
- Added ability to add patterns to web.xml so the Vary-header is not
  send, if these patterns match. Problems with IE8 and earlier can
  be solved with this

Version 1.7.1 2013-05-01
- Now, flush() will not force compression. This was simply causing
  too many issues.
- Compression threshold of 0 should now not force compression even
  when, for instance, the content type is excluded from compression
- Content-Type should be properly set even when compressing
- Content-Length should be properly set in some cases where it was
  not being set, even when not compressing

Version 1.7 2009-05-11
- Now does not compress content types like application/gzip
- Won't compress responses that already have a Content-Encoding
  like gzip

Version 1.7-rc1 2009-04-28
- Attempt to accommodate very large responses whose Content-Length
  header value exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE
- Always set Vary header
- Now attempts to set a modified ETag header when compressing
- Now avoid compressing if Cache-Control: no-transform is set
- Correctly handle multiple values in Content-Encoding header; other
  transforms are preserved
- Now should support deflated requests
- Update to latest support libs, like Mockrunner 0.4.1
- Various updates to match my current preferred coding style; small
  code tweaks and additional logging

Version 1.6.6, 2007-09-20
- Bug fix: empty response is no longer compressed, avoiding exception
  in compress/ZipOutputStream in this situation
- Modest code tweaks from static analysis

Version 1.6.5, 2007-07-14
- Added includeUserAgentPatterns and excludeUserAgentPatterns
  parameters to compress based on User-Agent
- Minor updates to use generic types in Enumerator, Iterator
  references
- Update to Mockrunner 0.4, newer IntelliJ annotations
- Properly included some licenses

Version 1.6.4, 2006-12-11
- Bug fix: close() and flush() implementations probably shouldn't
  throw IllegalStateException if the stream is already closed.
  In at least one case, Jetty gets confused by this.
- But they do need to throw IOException, apparently, if a write- or
  print-like method is called. Jetty wants this.
- Small improvement: if compressionThreshold is 0, compression begins
  earlier, saving a bit of overhead
- flush() implementations will now definitely flush all output to the
  response, even if it means beginning compression early.

Version 1.6.3, 2006-11-17
- Bug fix / improvement: handles case where setContentType() is
  called after getOutputStream(), such that parameters includeContentType
  and excludeContentType work even in this case.
- Bug fix: response input/compressed bytes stats were swapped!

Version 1.6.2, 2006-10-15
- Fixed bug #1571644: JakartaCommonsLoggingImpl and JavaUtilLoggingImpl
  are now public so that they may be instantiated by reflection correctly.

Version 1.6.1, 2006-09-01
- Now prefers certain encodings to others when Accept-Encoding header
  says several are equally good. For example, Accept-Encoding: deflate,gzip
  now gets gzip rather than deflate.
- Also fixed a potential bug in a rare case where the most-preferred encoding
  in the header was not supported, even though a less preferred encoding was.
  Filter was not compressing in this case.

Version 1.6, 2006-07-05
- Added support for compressed requests, including stats
- X-Compressed-By header only enabled in debug mode now
- Accept-Encoding header suppressed downstream if filter is handling
  compression
- Minor unit tests fixes and improvements
- Update to latest JUnit, Mockrunner, Commons Logging

Version 1.5.2, 2006-02-20
- Added include/excludePathPatterns parameters

Version 1.5.1, 2005-08-06
- More code cleanup following my update to IntelliJ 5.0
- Added ability to also log messages to java.util.logging.Logger
  or a Jakarta Commons Log

Version 1.5, 2005-05-16
- Updated for JDK 5.0, J2EE 1.4

Version 1.4.4, 2005-08-06
- Added ability to also log messages to a Jakarta Commons Log

Version 1.4.3, 2005-05-14
- Fix? -- avoid an IllegalStateException when an app server closes
  a response, then flushes it. This helps users of OC4J work around a
  possible bug.
- Minor cleanup of close()/flush() handling while I was at it
- Added LoadRunner class for load testing

Version 1.4.2, 2005-04-02
- Fix -- bug that would cause even small documents to be compressed.
- Fix -- NullPointerException from flushBuffer()
- Now, if documents sets a content length that is under the compression
  threshold, the filter will not bother buffering the output, which
  should increase performance on small files
- CompressingFilter tests now use Mockrunner
- Finally added some more unit tests, for CompressingFilter and
  StatsOutputStream

Version 1.4.1, 2005-03-08
- Added JPackage support (http://jpackage.org)
  Thanks to Joseph Wortmann for helping with this.

Version 1.4, 2005-02-05
- Fix -- content type was not set correctly in response when not compressing
- Possible fix -- additional checks to avoid an exception when flushing
  compressed streams after chain.doFilter()
- Now will start compressing immediately if content length is set to a value
  that exceeds the compression threshold
- CompressingHttpServletResponse was getting too complex and was modestly
  overhauled for simplicity. As a side effect it will be a little more
  strict about setting headers before writing content, which should not
  be a problem for applications. As long as you are not trying to set
  headers after obtaining a writer/output stream, and you shouldn't anyway,
  this should not affect you.

Version 1.3, 2004-12-28
- Minor fix -- in some cases the filter was closing the output stream even
  when the response was not compressed. It does not anymore.
- Added "includeContentTypes" and "excludeContentTypes" filter parameters,
  to allow applications to compress only certain content types
- Filter now delays calling getOutputStream() on the underlying response
  as long as possible, to avoid errors with containers like Tomcat that
  may later call getWriter() on the underlying response when rendering
  an error page.
- Added a few preliminary unit tests, which don't do much yet.
- Added better javadoc here and there.

Version 1.2, 2004-11-26
- Fixed bug that arose when application closed the output stream
- Application can now force encoding used in response
- Commented out assertions in released code to allow compilation under JDK 1.3
- Serializable classes now better follow conventions (e.g. include a
  serialVersionUID field)

Version 1.1.1, 2004-11-05
- If an app server applies CompressingFilter to a request/response multiple
  times (due to server-side forwards), the filter will no longer attempt to
  re-apply itself or compress the response twice.
- Fixed LICENSE.txt; should have been Apache 2.0 license!
- Minor code tweaks and cleanups following runs of code analysis tools

Version 1.1, 2004-06-11
- Added CompressingFilterStats statistics object
- Fixed NPE in CompressingFilter.destroy()
- Fixed incorrect behavior in reset(), resetBuffer(), whereby some buffered
  output would not be cleared
- Minor code revisions and additional logging, assertions

Version 1.0, 2004-06-04
- Initial revision
